/**
 * Represents a 'Fud' or a post on the Main Screen.
 *
 * The Fud post is what displays a post of a particular dish. There is a photo of the dish displayed.
 * (Photos are mandatory), along with this is some sort of upvote/downvote button, that may be
 * stylized, or just standard arrows (e.g. ^ V). The number of net votes will be displayed
 * (upvote - downvote) as well as the number of comments/reviews. The restaurant the dish is at will
 * also be displayed, as well as it’s cost. Optionally a “real rating” may be displayed, which
 * aggregates internal review comments and their ratings of the dish.
 * Optionally, a fud post may be saved.
